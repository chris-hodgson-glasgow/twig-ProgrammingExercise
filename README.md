How to run the method splitArrayEvenly

The first parameter is the original numeric array which is to be split
The second parameter is the the number of sub arrays that the first array is to be split into

The method returns a 2d array which is the requested sub arrays placed into a parent array

Edge cases:
If a null array reference is passed to the method it will return an empty array
if the number of sub arrays is greater than the number of elements the method will return ther original array
if the number of sub arrays is negative or 0 then the original array is returned
